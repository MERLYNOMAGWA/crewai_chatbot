Title: [DISCUSSION] How do you stay focused when working from home?

I’ve been remote for over a year and still struggle with concentration. I’ve tried:
- Pomodoro timers  
- Noise-canceling headphones  
- Scheduled breaks  

But I still get distracted easily. What habits, routines, or mindset shifts help you stay Zen and productive over time?

Looking forward to your tips and experiences!
