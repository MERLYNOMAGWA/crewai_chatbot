10 things NOT to say in a Job Interview,
(And what TO say instead):

Interviews are like first dates,
Awkward and hard.

You only get 30 minutes to:

✅ See if you’re a fit.
✅ Sell your strengths.
✅ Show your enthusiasm.

Don’t fall into the trap of sending the wrong message.

Avoid saying these 10 things:
(And what to say instead)

1/ "I don't have any questions."
↳ Why: Shows zero preparation or interest
↳ Instead: Ask specific questions about the team's current projects or culture

2/ "I’ll take any job right now."
↳ Why: Signals desperation, kills your negotiating power
↳ Instead: Highlight skills that match this specific role

3/ "I don't like taking direction."
↳ Why: Makes you seem uncoachable 
↳ Instead: Share how you've grown from feedback

4/ "I don’t have any weaknesses."
↳ Why: Sounds unrealistic and arrogant
↳ Instead: Share a real weakness and how you're improving

5/ "I hate my current boss."
↳ Why: Raises red flags about professionalism 
↳ Instead: Focus on your career growth goals

6/ "I'll figure it out as I go."
↳ Why: Suggests you don’t prepare
↳ Instead: Emphasize your (proven) ability to learn quickly

7/ "This is a stepping stone for me."
↳ Why: Companies don't want to invest in short-term employees
↳ Instead: Share your interest in growing with the company

8/ "What's your work-from-home policy?" (too early)
↳ Why: Makes work flexibility seem like your top priority
↳ Instead: First discuss role and fit and get them interested

9/ "What time do people leave?"
↳ Why: Implies you're just watching the clock
↳ Instead: Ask about daily workflows and responsibilities

10/ "I don't handle stress well."
↳ Why: Suggests you'll crack under pressure
↳ Instead: Describe how you organize work to manage deadlines

Remember:
Preparation and positivity go a long way.
